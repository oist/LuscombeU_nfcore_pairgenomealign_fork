        description: "Parameter for converting between scores and probability ratios.
          This affects the column ambiguity estimates. A score is converted to a probability
          ratio by this formula: exp(score / TEMPERATURE). The default value is 1/lambda,
          where lambda is the scale factor of the scoring matrix, which is calculated
          by the method of Yu and Altschul (YK Yu et al. 2003, PNAS 100(26):15688-93)."
